  summary: 'A guidance language for controlling large language models'
  description: |
    Guidance enables you to control modern language models more effectively and efficiently
    than traditional prompting or chaining. Guidance programs allow you to interleave generation,
    prompting, and logical control into a single continuous flow matching how the language model
    actually processes the text. Simple output structures like Chain of Thought and its many
    variants (e.g., ART, Auto-CoT, etc.) have been shown to improve LLM performance.
    The advent of more powerful LLMs like GPT-4 allows for even richer structure, and guidance
    makes that structure easier and cheaper.
